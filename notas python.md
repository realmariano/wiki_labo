## Python issues

2024-04

An issue started happening a month ago on CONDA. Both in my work and home pc: I could not install packages using CONDA, I was able to do it on PIP,
but that means that if I create a new ENV I could not install PIP either.

The error was:
_Conda SSL Error: OpenSSL appears to be unavailable on this machine. OpenSSL is required to download and install packages_

The solution I followed was:
